We will query a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data in this SQL.

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers LIMIT 20;
select count(orderid)
from bit_db.jansales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';        We found the amount of orders from January.
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust;      We summed the amount of iPhone orders.
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';           We ran an  INNER JOIN to locatea ll the account numbers associated with February orders.
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);        
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;             We located the cheapest product sold in January, along with the price.              
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;                      This is the total revenue for each product sold in January.           
SELECT
sum(Quantity),
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;                        We made a table that related products that were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, the amount of each were sold, and the total revenue.
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';        We counted the amount of customers that ordered more than 2 products at a time and ran a LEFT JOIN relating it to the average order size.
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;                We created a list of all the products sold in January and included the individual quantity of each item sold.
